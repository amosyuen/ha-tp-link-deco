## Functionality

This integration is a local polling integration that logs into the admin web UI for TP-Link Deco routers. Currently the only feature implemented is device trackers for active devices.

### Device Trackers

Device trackers are added for both decos and clients. The device tracker state marks whether the device is connected to the deco. If a device is not present, the previous values for attributes are saved except for `down_kilobytes_per_s` and `up_kilobytes_per_s`.

#### Common Attributes

| Attribute       | Example Values (comma separated) |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| mac             | 1A-B2-C3-4D-56-EF                |
| ip_address      | 192.168.0.100                    |
| device_class    | client, deco                     |
| connection_type | wired, band5, band2_4            |

#### Client Attributes

| Attribute            | Example Values (comma separated) |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| interface            | main, guest                      |
| down_kilobytes_per_s | 10.25                            |
| up_kilobytes_per_s   | 11.75                            |
| deco_device          | living_room                      |
| deco_mac             | 1A-B2-C3-4D-56-EF                |

#### Deco Attributes

| Attribute       | Example Values (comma separated) |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| hw_version      | 2.0                              |
| sw_version      | 1.5.1 Build 20210204 Rel. 50164  |
| device_model    | x60                              |
| internet_online | false, true                      |
| master          | false, true                      |
| bssid_band2_4   | A1:B2:C3:D4:E5:F6                |
| bssid_band5     | A1:B2:C3:D4:E5:F6                |
| signal_band2_4  | 3                                |
| signal_band2_4  | 4                                |

### Devices

A device is created for each deco. Each device contains the device_tracker entities for itself and any clients connected to it. Non-master deco devices will indicate that they are connected via the master deco device.

### Services

#### Reboot Deco Service

Reboots the specified decos. Example yaml:

```yaml
service: tplink_deco.reboot_deco
target:
  entity_id:
    - device_tracker.guest_room_deco
    - device_tracker.living_room_deco
```

{% if not installed %}

## Installation

### HACS

1. Install [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/)
2. Go to HACS "Integrations >" section
3. In the lower right click "+ Explore & Download repositories"
4. Search for "TP-Link Deco" and add it
   - HA Restart is not needed since it is configured in UI config flow
5. In the Home Assistant (HA) UI go to "Configuration"
6. Click "Integrations"
7. Click "+ Add Integration"
8. Search for "TP-Link Deco"

### Manual

1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your [HA configuration](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/) (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
2. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
3. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `tplink_deco`.
4. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/tplink_deco/` directory (folder) in this repository.
5. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
6. Restart Home Assistant
7. In the Home Assistant (HA) UI go to "Configuration"
8. Click "Integrations"
9. Click "+ Add Integration"
10. Search for "TP-Link Deco"

{% endif %}

## Configuration (Important! Please Read)

Config is done in the HA integrations UI.

### Login Credentials

The login credentials **MUST** be the deco **owner** credentials and the username should be left as **admin**. Manager credentials will **NOT** work.

Also whenever the owner logs in, all other sessions for the owner will be logged out. So if you log in with the owner credentials in the mobile app, it will cause the integration to be logged out, sometimes resulting in 403 errors. Since the integration has built in retry on auth errors, the integration will re-login, but that will logout your mobile app login session.

Recommend that you create a separate manager account with full permissions to manage the router manually in the mobile app and use the owner credentials only for this integration. If you need to use the owner account to do some manual management, recommend disabling this integration temporarily.

### Verify SSL Certificate

Turn off this config option if your browser gives you a warning that the SSL certificate is self-signed when you visit the router host IP in your browser.

### Disable new entities

If you prefer new entities to be disabled by default:

1. In the Home Assistant (HA) UI go to "Configuration"
2. Click "Integrations"
3. Click the three dots in the bottom right corner fo the TP-Link Deco integration
4. Click "System options"
5. Disable "Enable newly added entities"
